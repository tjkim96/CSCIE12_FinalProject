This website explores a coffee ratings dataset from: https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/coffee/

You can browse coffees by country and view details like region, year, owner, species, and total score.

For this project, I wanted to try implementing a rudimentary password system. The United States data is password-protected for demonstration purposes. If you click Browse Coffee By Country --> United States, the page shows a password popup and hides the coffee cards. If the correct password ("myPassword" without quotes) is entered, the cards appear. The password must be re-entered every time the US page is revisited.

No other data is needed to load/run the project -- npm run dev should be all!
